# Course Syllabus: Python and Mathematics for Machine Learning

**Instructor:** Anthony Mauro
**Course Number:** CSE-90162

## Course Description

This course provides a foundational understanding of Python programming and essential mathematical concepts for machine learning.  A large volume of material is covered, so it is crucial to keep up with the pacing.  The topics in Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra have been selected to provide the most applicable base of knowledge needed for subsequent courses in this series. You'll learn about Python language development environments, data structures, recursion, advanced functions, and the machine learning libraries: Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Textbook

*   "Python and Math Essentials for Machine Learning - A Beginner's Guide"
    *   [https://store.bookbaby.com/book/python-and-math-essentials-for-machine-learning](https://store.bookbaby.com/book/python-and-math-essentials-for-machine-learning)

## Course Prerequisites

N/A. No advanced mathematics is required, however a strong mastery of high school algebra is recommended. Some experience in a programming language (e.g. Java, C/C++, Javascript) is also recommended, but not required.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

*   Create Python programming language scripts in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebooks to implement and provide organized representations of simulations in probability and statistical inference.
*   Implement, analyze, and debug Python program flow constructs, data structures, and functions including recursive algorithms, and organize programs into Object-oriented-programming (OOP) frameworks.
*   Describe a data set including both categorical and quantitative variables to support or refute a statement.
*   Apply laws of probability to concrete problems in Machine Learning and Data Science.
*   Apply mathematical tools including calculus, linear algebra, and statistics in the description and development of Machine Learning models.
*   Write and test working Python programs from a generic problem statement through algorithm development, design and implementation, unit test, integration, and final test.

## Course Materials

Required Materials: Lecture materials/videos will be posted in each module of course in Canvas. You will be expected to review the materials prior to attempting the assignments.
